Commands: Auto, Each, Help, List, Pattern, Reset, Show, Quit.
(commands are not case sensitive and first letter is sufficient.)

...Auto: automatically parse the sample names from the filenames,
...Each: treat each filename as a separate sample,
...Help: prints this message,
...List: lists all of the (remaining) filename(s),
...Pattern pattern: glob-style search pattern to get a subset of filenames
      ("*" or "*.*" is all files,
       "*.txt" is all files that have a "txt" extension,
       "a*" is all files that start with the letter "a",
       "*string*" is all files that contain "string", etc.),
...Reset: start over,
...Show: print the current samples and associated files [verbose],
...Done: exit from the command loop and return to processing.
```
